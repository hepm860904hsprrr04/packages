# Understand packages in Java
 Packaging is a common approach used to organize related clases and interfaces. Most reusable code is packaged.
 
 Packages are thougth of a container for clases, but actually they define where clases will be located in the hierarchical directory structure.


Package attribute considerations:
<ul>
<li>Use a reverse domain name for the package structure.</li>
 <li>Use lowercase  characters delimited with underscores to separate words in package names</li>
 </ul>
